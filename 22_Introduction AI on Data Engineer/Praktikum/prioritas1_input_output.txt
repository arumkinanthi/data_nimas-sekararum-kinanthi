Sure! Here's a basic schema for storing expense data in a relational database:

   sql
   CREATE TABLE Users (
      UserID INT PRIMARY KEY,
      UserName VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
      Email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
      Password VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
      JoinDate DATE NOT NULL
   );

   CREATE TABLE Categories (
      CategoryID INT PRIMARY KEY,
      CategoryName VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL
   );

   CREATE TABLE Expenses (
      ExpenseID INT PRIMARY KEY,
      UserID INT,
      CategoryID INT,
      Amount DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL,
      Description TEXT,
      ExpenseDate DATE NOT NULL,
      FOREIGN KEY (UserID) REFERENCES Users(UserID),
      FOREIGN KEY (CategoryID) REFERENCES Categories(CategoryID)
   );
   
This schema includes three tables

Users: Stores information about users who submit expenses.
- UserID: Primary key identifying the user.
- UserName: Name of the user.
- Email: Email address of the user.
- Password: Hashed password of the user.
- JoinDate: Date when the user joined.
Categories: Stores expense categories.
- CategoryID: Primary key identifying the category.
- CategoryName: Name of the category.
Expenses: Stores individual expense records.
- ExpenseID: Primary key identifying the expense.
- UserID: Foreign key referencing the user who submitted the expense.
- CategoryID: Foreign key referencing the category of the expense.
- Amount: The amount of the expense.
- Description: Description of the expense.
- ExpenseDate: Date when the expense occurred.
You can expand on this schema based on your specific requirements, such as adding more details to the Users table (e.g., address, phone number) or including additional tables for more complex data relationships (e.g., splitting expenses into multiple parts).
